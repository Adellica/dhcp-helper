version 0.6   Replace netlink code with old-fashioned ioctl, since
	      netlink ARP is buggy in some kernels.

version 0.5   Fixed buffer-expansion code. My understanding of the
	      return-code semantics of recvfrom was faulty.

version 0.4   Re-do network access to use the RTnetlink system and
	      ARP-injection instead of raw packet access. Packet sockets
	      are no longer required, and things like IPsec should now
              work.

version 0.3   Debian packaging changes only.

version 0.2   Added support for broadcast and better parameter sanity 
	      checking.

version 0.1   Initial version.
